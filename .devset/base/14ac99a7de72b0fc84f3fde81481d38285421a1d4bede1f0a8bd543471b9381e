# Sources

Read this before a rule of this skill needs backing, before citing a source in a
doc or a review, and before adapting a rule from somewhere else. It says what
each source holds, which rule it backs, where this skill departs from it, and
the notice owed for the text it adapts. Cite one of these, or an equally primary
source; open the page before linking it.

## Corrected Here

Claims of rust-skills that fail on the pinned toolchain or against the sources
above, and what this skill says instead:

- `mod_module_files` and `self_named_module_files` are swapped: it is
  `self_named_module_files` that asks for `mod.rs`.
- A crate cannot set its own lint levels beside `[lints] workspace = true`:
  Cargo refuses the manifest.
- A group set beside a lint of its own at one priority fails; the group takes
  `priority = -1`. `clippy.toml` cannot set a level at all.
- `pub(super)` reaches the parent module and everything inside it.
- `#[must_use]` on a function that returns a `Result` fails
  `clippy::double_must_use`; an inherent `to_string` fails
  `clippy::inherent_to_string`.
- A newtype over a `String` cannot derive `Copy`, and `&mut T` is not `Copy`.
- No attribute sets a field's `Default`; `#[default]` marks an enum's variant.
- A sealed trait is sealed whole: no caller implements any part of it.
- A `&Path` parameter takes a `&PathBuf`, not a `&str`.

## Adapted Text

Rules of this skill adapt rules of
[leonardomso/rust-skills](https://github.com/leonardomso/rust-skills), at
v1.0.0, the copy sockudo vendors, and at v1.5.1 for `TryFrom` over `as`,
explicit overflow and exhaustive matches, rewritten for edition 2024 and this
workspace, and checked by compiling: the lowercase message, thiserror in a
library, a `Result` over a panic, `expect` for a broken invariant, an error
dropped by name, `From` over `Into`, `#[must_use]` on builders and results,
newtypes, checking at the boundary, typestate, sealed traits, the common traits,
`Default`, generic bounds, the size assertion, `TryFrom` over `as`, explicit
overflow, exhaustive matches, slices over owned parameters, borrowing over
cloning, `Copy` by value, `Arc` and `Rc`, `Cow`, lifetime elision, `mod.rs`,
`pub(crate)` and `pub(super)`, flat re-exports, the naming rules and workspace
lints.
