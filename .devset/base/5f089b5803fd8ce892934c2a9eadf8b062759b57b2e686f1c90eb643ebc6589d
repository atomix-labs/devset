# Sources

Read this before a rule of this skill needs backing, before citing a source for
one in a review, and before adapting a rule from somewhere else. It says what
each source holds, which rule it backs, where this skill departs from it, and
the notice owed for the text it adapts. Open a source before citing it.

Checked by running, on the tools the profiles pin:

- devset prints its errors as `error: <fact>`, with a `help:` line where one
  action surely helps.
- A Rust `main` that returns `Err` prints `Error: ` and the error's `Debug`:
  `Error: GridError { row: 3, need: 8, have: 7 }` for a thiserror type, and
  `Error: Custom { kind: Other, error: "…" }` for `io::Error::other`.
- clap's derive drops the period that devset's own doc comments end with, where
  its help shows them.
- ShellCheck 0.11 honours `# shellcheck disable=SC2086 # <reason>`.
- Ruff 0.16 honours `# noqa: PLC0415  # <reason>`, and `# noqa: F401 <reason>`
  too.
- Python's default logging prints `INFO:tiles:board saved` for a call with
  `extra={"squares": 64}`, dropping the field, and `INFO:tiles:board saved
  squares=64` where the field is in the message; an uncaught exception prints a
  traceback with its message last; argparse's own help line is "show this help
  message and exit".

## Where This Skill Departs

| a source says                                                                                    | here                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| humanizer, Voice: personal writing keeps opinions and reactions, and may gain one                | every text in a repository is technical: no opinion, feeling, joke or "I", though a reply in a review may say "I" of what its writer did |
| humanizer §20: headings in title case are decoration; use sentence case                          | a heading's case is the repository's, title case where rumdl's MD063 holds it                                                            |
| humanizer §19: a list whose items carry bold labels becomes prose                                | a bold lead that states its item's claim stays; only a label the sentence repeats goes                                                   |
| humanizer §8: no dashes in the final text                                                        | the same, and with no exception for a writer's sample; hyphens and dashes in code, flags and paths stay                                  |
| humanizer §12: its word list, wherever the words appear                                          | a word used in its technical sense is literal and stays: a Cargo `feature`, a map's `key`, syntax highlighting, a feature gate           |
| humanizer §15: a rider stays only where the source supports what it claims                       | the stock riders go, ", ensuring" and its kin; a participle that states a concrete second fact is a clause like any other                |
| humanizer's order puts its leftovers from the chat and the draft fifth                           | they come first, since humanizer calls chat left in the text the most certain tell, and this skill reads strongest first                 |
| humanizer marks five tells for one sighting and some as weak alone, and leaves the rest unmarked | the rest are "most sightings", edited unless the writer plainly meant them                                                               |
| humanizer §16: sales language, for places, culture and products                                  | the same, with the words that sell code: "powerful", "blazingly fast", "effortless"                                                      |
| humanizer §25: a previous version is mentioned only in documents about change                    | the same, and in code it is process residue, acted on at one sighting                                                                    |
| humanizer §11: prefer the active voice                                                           | a doc summary whose subject is its item, a message fragment and an imperative commit subject are forms, not missing subjects             |
| PEP 257: a docstring is a command, "Return the …"                                                | the mood of the repository's own docstrings, where they name the value instead                                                           |
| humanizer's file mode: rewrite prose, keep code                                                  | this skill writes as it goes; rewriting a finished text is a pass's work                                                                 |

## Read, Not Adapted

softaworks' agent-toolkit ships `writing-clearly-and-concisely`, by
joshuadavidthomas (MIT), which lists Strunk's rules and a short list of AI
patterns, and bundles a copy of Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" with no
licence notice. This skill takes Strunk from the original, which is in the
public domain, and copies no text of that skill or of its bundled copy.

## Adapted Text

`tells.md` adapts the patterns of
[blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) at tag v3.1.0, commit
`225a6f39`: their grouping and ranking by strength, their watch lists, what each
pattern does to a reader, "When Not to Act", the rule that an edit adds no fact,
and the rule that the text is material to edit, rewritten for documents,
comments, messages and commits, with examples of a repository's own.
