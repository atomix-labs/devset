# Atomics

Read this before a value is shared between threads through anything but a lock
or a channel: an atomic, a fence, a `static` that changes, an `unsafe impl Sync`
over shared state. It says which orderings a protocol needs, how each is written
down, and how atomics are reached so a model checker can see them.

An ordering is a promise about what else a thread sees. A `Release` store
publishes everything its thread wrote before it; an `Acquire` load that reads
the value it stored sees all of that. `Relaxed` orders nothing but the atomic
itself. `SeqCst` adds one order every thread agrees on across all `SeqCst`
operations and fences. A data race, two accesses to one place that nothing
orders, one a write and one not atomic, is undefined behaviour; a wrong ordering
between atomics is not, but it lets a thread act on a value another has not
finished, which is the same bug one step removed.

What an atomic costs when threads share its cache line, and how long a spin
should wait, are `tuning-rust-performance`'s.

## Shared State Is a Lock, a `OnceLock` or an Atomic, Never `static mut`

`static mut` is a global any thread may write, whose every access is unsafe with
a proof no module can keep, and edition 2024 denies taking a reference to it. A
value set once is a `OnceLock`, a value that changes is a `Mutex` or an
`RwLock`, and a lone word, a flag or a count, is an atomic. A lock's proof is
the standard library's; an atomic protocol is one the crate proves itself,
ordering by ordering, so it is written only where a measured lock costs too
much.

```rust,compile_fail
// fails: static_mut_refs
static mut TILESET: Vec<char> = Vec::new();

#[expect(unsafe_code, reason = "the tile set installed once at startup")]
pub fn install(glyphs: &[char]) {
    // Bad: a `&mut` to a global any thread may take one of too.
    // SAFETY: `install` runs once, before any thread starts.
    let tileset = unsafe { &mut TILESET };
    tileset.extend_from_slice(glyphs);
}
```

```rust
use std::sync::OnceLock;

use thiserror::Error;

static TILESET: OnceLock<Vec<char>> = OnceLock::new();

#[derive(Debug, Error, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[error("install error: a tile set is installed already")]
pub struct InstallError {
    pub refused: Vec<char>,
}

pub fn install(glyphs: Vec<char>) -> Result<(), InstallError> {
    TILESET.set(glyphs).map_err(|refused| InstallError { refused })
}

#[must_use]
pub fn tileset() -> Option<&'static [char]> {
    TILESET.get().map(Vec::as_slice)
}
```

Held by `static_mut_refs`, which edition 2024 denies, for a reference to a
`static mut`. A read or write by value, `COUNT = COUNT.wrapping_add(1)`,
compiles, and only its `unsafe` block marks it, so it is held by review.

## Reach Atomics Through One Module, so `--cfg loom` Swaps Them

A model checker such as loom sees only the atomics, cells and threads that are
its own. So a crate with an atomic protocol takes its atomics, `fence`,
`UnsafeCell` and `spin_loop` from one module of its own, which re-exports
`core`'s and, under `--cfg loom`, loom's, and the same body is both the
production code and the model. Loom's types differ in small ways the module
covers: its atomics have no `const fn new`, so a `static` atomic is modelled
through `loom::lazy_static!`, nor `get_mut`, so a `&mut self` reads them with a
`Relaxed` load, and its `UnsafeCell` is reached through `with` and `with_mut`.

```text
// grid.rs
// Bad: `core`'s atomic, which a loom model cannot see.
use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
```

```text
// sync.rs: every atomic the crate uses, from one place.
#[cfg(not(loom))]
pub(crate) use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, AtomicU8, Ordering, fence};
#[cfg(loom)]
pub(crate) use loom::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, AtomicU8, Ordering, fence};

// grid.rs
use crate::sync::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
```

Held by review. `verifying.md` shows the model, and how the workspace declares
the cfg.

## Every Atomic Operation Has an `// ORDERING:` That Names What It Pairs With

An ordering is chosen for what it pairs with: a `Release` store with the
`Acquire` loads that read it, and the other way about. The `// ORDERING:`
comment above each operation names the ordering and that pair, "Release, pairing
with the Acquire load in `winner`", or says it publishes nothing; a function
whose operations all share one ordering says so once at its top, "Relaxed
throughout". A reader then checks each pair from both ends, and a change to one
end finds the other.

```rust
use core::sync::atomic::Ordering::Relaxed;
use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, AtomicU8};

#[derive(Debug, Default)]
pub struct Game {
    winner: AtomicU8,
    over: AtomicBool,
}

impl Game {
    pub fn finish(&self, winner: u8) {
        self.winner.store(winner, Relaxed);
        // Bad: `Relaxed` orders nothing, so a reader may see the game over and no winner yet.
        self.over.store(true, Relaxed);
    }

    #[must_use]
    pub fn winner(&self) -> Option<u8> {
        self.over.load(Relaxed).then(|| self.winner.load(Relaxed))
    }
}
```

```rust
use core::sync::atomic::Ordering::{Acquire, Relaxed, Release};
use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, AtomicU8};

#[derive(Debug, Default)]
pub struct Game {
    winner: AtomicU8,
    over: AtomicBool,
}

impl Game {
    pub fn finish(&self, winner: u8) {
        // ORDERING: Relaxed; the Release store of `over` below publishes it.
        self.winner.store(winner, Relaxed);
        // ORDERING: Release, pairing with the Acquire load in `winner`, so a reader that sees the
        // game over sees the winner stored before it.
        self.over.store(true, Release);
    }

    #[must_use]
    pub fn winner(&self) -> Option<u8> {
        // ORDERING: Acquire, pairing with the Release store in `finish`.
        let over = self.over.load(Acquire);
        // ORDERING: Relaxed; the Acquire load above orders it after the store `finish` published.
        over.then(|| self.winner.load(Relaxed))
    }
}
```

Held by review, and by a loom model of the pair.

## `Relaxed` Where Nothing Pairs

An atomic that publishes nothing but its own value, a stop flag or a statistic,
needs no ordering, and a stronger one "to be safe" may cost a barrier on every
access, and tells a reader a pairing exists that does not. Whatever else such a
word's readers rely on is ordered by something else, a join or a lock, which its
`// ORDERING:` names.

```rust
use core::sync::atomic::AtomicBool;
use core::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst;

#[derive(Debug, Default)]
pub struct Renderer {
    stop: AtomicBool,
}

impl Renderer {
    pub fn stop(&self) {
        // Bad: `SeqCst` to be safe, which orders nothing this flag needs, and says nothing why.
        self.stop.store(true, SeqCst);
    }

    #[must_use]
    pub fn stopped(&self) -> bool {
        self.stop.load(SeqCst)
    }
}
```

```rust
use core::sync::atomic::AtomicBool;
use core::sync::atomic::Ordering::Relaxed;

#[derive(Debug, Default)]
pub struct Renderer {
    stop: AtomicBool,
}

impl Renderer {
    pub fn stop(&self) {
        // ORDERING: Relaxed; the flag publishes nothing but itself, and whoever waits for the
        // renderer to end joins its thread, which orders the rest.
        self.stop.store(true, Relaxed);
    }

    #[must_use]
    pub fn stopped(&self) -> bool {
        // ORDERING: Relaxed, as in `stop`.
        self.stop.load(Relaxed)
    }
}
```

Held by review.

## `SeqCst` Only with Its Reason, and as a Fence Between a Store and a Load

`Release` and `Acquire` order what a thread does before a store, and what it
does after a load, but never a store before a later load: each of two threads
may store its own flag and then read the other's as it was before either store.
Where a protocol rests on that order, two sides that each announce and then
look, a `SeqCst` fence between the store and the load puts every such fence in
one order, so one side's look comes after the other's announcement. That order
is what `SeqCst` buys, and it is written only where a protocol rests on it, with
an `// ORDERING:` paragraph that says how. It is a fence rather than `SeqCst`
accesses, which loom models only as `AcqRel`.

```rust
use core::sync::atomic::AtomicBool;
use core::sync::atomic::Ordering::{Acquire, Release};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum Painter {
    Left,
    Right,

        // Bad: the load may see the other painter's flag as it was before its store, and so may
        // theirs of this one: both paint.
        if theirs.load(Acquire) {
            mine.store(false, Release);
            return false;
        }

        // what this one painted.

    }
}
```

Held by review, and by a loom model, which finds both painters inside without
the fence.

## A `compare_exchange` Chooses Both Orderings

A `compare_exchange` has an ordering for when it succeeds, and one for when it
fails, which only reads: `Release` or `AcqRel` there is refused. A claim that
takes what the last holder released succeeds with `Acquire`, and a failure that
acts on nothing it read is `Relaxed`. `compare_exchange_weak` may fail
spuriously, so it belongs in a loop that retries; a lone attempt is
`compare_exchange`.

```rust,compile_fail
// fails: invalid_atomic_ordering
use core::sync::atomic::AtomicU32;
use core::sync::atomic::Ordering::{Acquire, Release};

#[derive(Debug, Default)]
pub struct Claim {
    owner: AtomicU32,
}

impl Claim {
    #[must_use]
    pub fn try_claim(&self, editor: u32) -> bool {
        // Bad: a failed exchange writes nothing, so it has nothing to release.
        self.owner.compare_exchange(0, editor, Acquire, Release).is_ok()
    }
}
```

```rust
use core::num::NonZeroU32;
use core::sync::atomic::AtomicU32;
use core::sync::atomic::Ordering::{Acquire, Relaxed, Release};

use thiserror::Error;

const FREE: u32 = 0;

#[derive(Debug, Error, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[error("claim error: editor {held} holds the square")]
pub struct ClaimError {
    pub held: u32,
}

#[derive(Debug, Default)]
pub struct Claim {
    owner: AtomicU32,
}

impl Claim {
    pub fn try_claim(&self, editor: NonZeroU32) -> Result<(), ClaimError> {
        // ORDERING: Acquire on success, pairing with the Release store in `release`, so this
        // editor sees what the last one wrote; Relaxed on failure, which acts on nothing it read.
        self.owner
            .compare_exchange(FREE, editor.get(), Acquire, Relaxed)
            .map(drop)
            .map_err(|held| ClaimError { held })
    }

    pub fn release(&self) {
        // ORDERING: Release, pairing with the Acquire exchange in `try_claim`.
        self.owner.store(FREE, Release);
    }
}
```

Held by `invalid_atomic_ordering`, which refuses a failure ordering that writes,
a load that releases and a store that acquires.

## A Type Over an `UnsafeCell` Is `Sync` with the Bound Its Access Needs

An `UnsafeCell` field takes `Sync` away, and the `unsafe impl` that gives it
back takes the bound that matches what `&self` lets a thread do with the `T`
inside. A lock lends one thread at a time a `&mut T`, through which it can swap
a `T` in or out, so a `T` crosses threads: its `Sync` needs `T: Send`, as
`Mutex`'s does, not `T: Sync`, which would let a thread swap out a `MutexGuard`
that must stay on the thread that took it. A type that lends `&T` to several
threads at once needs `T: Sync`, and one that does both, as `RwLock` and
`OnceLock` do, needs both. The cell comes from the crate's atomics module too,
reached through `with_mut` as loom's is, so a model sees every access to it.

```text
// Bad: `with` lends `&mut T`, so a `T` that is `Sync` but not `Send`, a `MutexGuard`, can be
// swapped out onto another thread.
// SAFETY: sharing the lock shares `&T`s, which `T: Sync` allows.
#[expect(unsafe_code, reason = "an `UnsafeCell` field takes away the auto `Sync`")]
unsafe impl<T: Sync> Sync for SpinLock<T> {}

Held by review, and by a loom model, which reports two threads in the cell at
once when the lock's orderings are too weak.

The lock shows the orderings a lock needs; how long a waiter spins before it
blocks, and whether a spin pays at all, are `tuning-rust-performance`'s.

## A Pointer Shared Across Threads Is an `AtomicPtr`

An `AtomicUsize` holds an address, and an address has no provenance, so a
pointer stored in one comes back as a guess. `AtomicPtr<T>` holds the pointer
itself, provenance and all, and its loads and stores order what it points at
like any other atomic's.

```rust
use core::ptr;
use core::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize;
use core::sync::atomic::Ordering::{Acquire, Release};

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Tileset {
    pub glyphs: [char; 4],
}

#[derive(Debug, Default)]
pub struct Theme {
    // Bad: an address, so the tile set's provenance is dropped with each store.
    current: AtomicUsize,
}

impl Theme {
    pub fn set(&self, tileset: &'static Tileset) {

        unsafe { current.as_ref() }
    }
}

        // ORDERING: Release, pairing with the Acquire load in `get`, so a reader sees the tile set
        // as it was built.
        self.current.store(ptr::from_ref(tileset).cast_mut(), Release);
    }

    #[must_use]

Under `nightly`, `implicit_provenance_casts` refuses the `as` casts an
`AtomicUsize` of pointers would otherwise need.

## A Node Another Thread May Read Is Freed Only Through a Reclamation Scheme

In a structure without a lock, a thread that has loaded a pointer to a node may
read the node after another thread unlinks it, so freeing it then is a use after
free. Its address, reused by a new node, also lets a `compare_exchange` that
expects the old node succeed on the new one and link in a `next` long gone, the
ABA problem. So a node another thread may still read is freed only once none
can: through a reclamation scheme, epochs or hazard pointers, as
`crossbeam-epoch` provides, or not before the whole structure drops, when `&mut
self` proves no reader is left.

head, and not the nodes' fields, which are not loom's cells; a reclamation
scheme's own proofs are its crate's.
