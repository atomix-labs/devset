description: Use when a repository is about to go public or cut its first public release, when asked whether a project is ready to open-source or to publish to crates.io, or when a first release went out and its pages are to be checked; also when GitHub's description, topics, website, social preview, labels or release environment are to be set. Covers everything a stranger meets, from the README, each crate's metadata, the book and the logo to GitHub's settings and crates.io's trusted publishing, what only the owner can set, and the checks once the release is out.

# Preparing a Release for Open Source

A repository's first public release is the day strangers arrive, each landing on
one page of it, and every page they can land on must be whole by then, since a
release never changes once it is out. This skill lists what each page needs and
checks it end to end, before the release and once it is out. Each item says what
holds it, a check or a look, and whose it is: an agent's token seldom opens a
repository's settings, so what only the owner can set is handed to the owner,
with its value, never skipped.

## Rules

1. **Nothing is released until every item below is done, or the owner has said
   why it waits**, since a reader judges the project by the first page they
   meet, and a version published without its README or its picture keeps that
   page for good.
2. **What the owner must set is handed over with the value to set**: the
   description word for word, the topics, the website, the file to upload, the
   name to type, so the owner sets each in one pass.
3. **Each value is copied from its one source**: the tagline from the
   `description` variable, which the README's header and GitHub's description
   both show, so the pages never disagree.

## Before the Release

### The README and Each Crate

- **The README holds what `writing-readmes` says**, in its order, every command
  run as shown, its install line taking the project from where it is released.
- **Every published crate shows a README on crates.io**, the root README for the
  one crate it is for and its own for every other, every link and image in it
  absolute, and carries its `homepage`, `keywords`, `categories` and licence
  files: `just check-cargo-publish` holds each.
- **Why each field is there** is `editing-cargo-manifests`'s.

### The Book

- **The book holds a chapter for each concept a user must learn**, then how to
  choose, performance where it matters, platforms and features, interop, testing
  and the alternatives: a book that is still the scaffold's two pages is not
  ready.
- **The outline is `writing-the-book`'s**, with what each chapter holds.
- **`just check-mdbook` passes**, and the book's URL, below, is the target of
  the README's book badge.

### The Logo

- **The logo, the favicon and the social card are drawn as `drawing-the-logo`
  says**, and the owner confirmed the mark.
- **`logo` is set**, so the README's header shows the logo.
- **`book_logo` and `book_social` are set**, so the book's menu bar shows the
  mark and a shared link to the book shows the card.

### GitHub

These are the repository's settings. An agent proposes each value, and sets one
only where its token has admin:

```text
Description  Share your repositories' configuration, and keep it in sync without losing local edits.
Website      https://atomix-labs.github.io/devset/
Topics       <the language>, <the domain>, <what a search would use>
```

```sh
gh repo edit atomix-labs/devset --description "<description>" --homepage <website> --add-topic <topic>
```

- **The description is the tagline**, word for word, and **the website** the
  page a reader goes to next.
- **The social preview is `social.png`**, uploaded in Settings, General, Social
  preview, since GitHub reads no file of the repository for it and has no API to
  set it.
- **The release environment is named exactly `release`**, as `release.yml`'s
  `environment:` names it, in Settings, Environments, and so is the one each
  trusted publisher names: GitHub makes a bare `release` on the first run where
  there is none, without the rules set on one named otherwise, as `releases`,
  and crates.io refuses a token to a run whose environment its publisher does
  not name.
- **The labels say where a change lands**: a workspace adds an `area: <crate>`
  label for each crate, and `area: docs`, `area: ci` and `area: performance`
  where they fit, each with the `paths` it covers, in `.github/labels.toml`,
  since a label with `paths` is set on a pull request by the files it changes.
  `just check-github-labels` holds the file.

  ```toml
  [labels."area: tiles-geometry"]
  color       = "c5def5"
  description = "Squares and the moves between them"
  paths       = ["crates/tiles-geometry/**"]

  [labels."area: docs"]
  color       = "c5def5"
  description = "The book and the READMEs"
  paths       = ["docs/**", "**/*.md"]

  [labels."area: ci"]
  color       = "c5def5"
  description = "The workflows and the recipes"
  paths       = [".github/**", ".just/**", "justfile"]

  [labels."area: performance"]
  color       = "c5def5"
  description = "The benchmarks, and what they measure"
  paths       = ["crates/*/benches/**"]
  ```

### Crates.io

- **The first version of each crate is published by hand, by the owner**, since
  crates.io trusts a workflow only for a crate it has: from the release commit,
  once it is on the default branch and before the tag, each crate after those it
  depends on, with a token of the owner's from crates.io's API tokens.

  ```sh
  cargo publish -p <crate>
  ```

- **Each crate's trusted publisher is set** in its settings on crates.io, and
  only then is the tag pushed, so the release's `publish` job takes its token
  and finds every version published:

  ```text
  Repository   atomix-labs/devset
  Workflow     release.yml
  Environment  release
  ```

### Files Written Once

- **Each file devset wrote once carries today's values**: the release notes'
  opening line is the tagline, and the issue chooser and `SUPPORT.md` link
  Discussions where it is on. A `once` file never follows a variable or a
  feature changed after its first write, so `devset diff <file>` on each `once`
  file `devset status -v` lists shows what the profile would write now, and the
  difference is brought over by hand.

## After the Release

Once the release run is done, open each page a stranger lands on:

- **The GitHub Release has its notes**: `gh release view <tag>`.
- **A shared link shows the card**: the repository's URL, pasted where a link
  unfurls, shows `social.png`.
- **Each crate's page on crates.io shows its README**, every image in it, and
  its description, keywords, categories, homepage, repository and licence:

  ```sh
  curl -fsS -A 'atomix-labs/devset release check' https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<crate> \
      | jq '.crate | {max_version, description, homepage, repository, keywords, categories}'
  ```

- **docs.rs built each crate**: its builds page,
  `https://docs.rs/crate/<crate>/<version>/builds`, shows the build succeeded.
- **The book is deployed**, with its logo and favicon, from the default branch's
  last `check` run:

  ```sh
  curl -fsS -o /dev/null https://atomix-labs.github.io/devset/
  ```

## Steps

1. **Walk Before the Release**, each item as it says, and mark each done,
   missing, or the owner's.
2. **Fix what is missing** that the repository holds, as the skill it names
   says, and run the checks below.
3. **Hand the owner the rest in one message**: each setting, where it is, and
   its value, as the checklist gives it.
4. **Release** once every item is done, or the owner has said why it waits.
5. **Walk After the Release**, and report to the owner each page that falls
   short, with what it shows.

The release itself is `cutting-releases`'s, which ends with After the Release.

## Checks

- `just check`: every check, as CI runs them.
- `just check-cargo-publish`: each crate's README, links, metadata and licence
  files.
- `just check-mdbook`: the book builds, and runs its examples.
- `just check-github-labels`: the labels and their paths.

No check sees a repository's settings, a registry's, or a page as a stranger
meets it: each is opened and read.

## What Not to Do

| Thought                                         | Instead                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "The token cannot set the topics; skip them"    | Name them, with their values, for the owner to set. |
| "A description of our own reads better"         | The tagline, word for word: one source.             |
| "The release run passed, so the pages are fine" | Open each page a stranger lands on.                 |
| "The book can follow in a later release"        | It is where the README's badge sends readers.       |
| "Push the tag, then set crates.io's publisher"  | The trusted publisher first, or `publish` fails.    |
| "Publish the first version from a branch"       | From the release commit, on the default branch.     |
