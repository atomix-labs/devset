# Sources

Read this before citing a source for an attack class in a finding, and before
adapting a class or a step from somewhere else. It says what each source holds,
which part of this pass it backs, where the pass departs from Cloudflare's
method, and the notice owed for the text it adapts. Cite one of these, or an
equally primary source; open the page before linking it.

## Adapted Text

This pass adapts the method of
[cloudflare/security-audit-skill](https://github.com/cloudflare/security-audit-skill)
at commit c1c8a8c: a finding only with a concrete path across a trust boundary,
from the input to the harm; an inventory of where input enters before the hunt;
the strongest check on a path read before a candidate stands; self-impact and a
missing best practice reported as nothing; a candidate that turns on a fact
outside the source kept apart, with no severity; severity no greater than what
the path shows; and a coverage list of what was checked. The words are this
pass's own. It carries this notice:
