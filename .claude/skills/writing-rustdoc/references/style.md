# Style: Voice, Compaction, and What to Cut

## 1 Summary Lines

The first paragraph is what rustdoc shows in every listing. It is one sentence,
fits one line when it can (a second line is a clause of the same sentence or an
invariant, never a third), ends with a period, and carries information the name
does not. Then a blank `///` line, then the body.

An article is fine (`A range of the address space…`, `The raw address.`). Never
article + the item's own kind (`A struct that…`, `A trait for…`, `A function
which…`). Never open with `This`, `Returns`, `Creates`, `Represents`, `Used`,
`Helper`, `Wrapper`, `Provides`, `Allows`.

## 2 Body Prose

State, in this order and only when true:

1. **Why it exists / when to use it**, and when not: `Prefer [`x`] for …, so …`.
2. **The contract**: what is guaranteed, in what order, what remains on failure.
3. **The reason for each non-obvious choice**, as fact + consequence in one
   sentence: *"pin-init's derive emits `::pin_init::` absolute paths with no way
   to redirect them, which makes every consumer depend on a crate it never
   names."*
4. **The cost**: allocation, copy, lock, syscall, `compare_exchange`, "one
   `memcpy`".

Never: how it works (the code shows it), a parameter-by-parameter description,
the return type, the derive list, a repeat of the summary, what a linked item
does, who consumes this crate.

Enumerated properties of a type go in bullets with a bold lead: `-
**Move-only.** Laying a structure into a region consumes it, so …`. Three
bullets is the norm; two is a sentence.

Speak the crate's own domain and keep its nouns fixed: in `wtx-init` a *slot* is
the destination, a *run* is `n` slots, a *source* is a `RunInit`, an initializer
*refuses* rather than fails. Define a coined noun once, where the type is, and
link every later use. A term that only makes sense to someone who already knows
the design is a defect.

Each crate speaks for itself: link a dependency's type where the guarantee comes
from it, never describe a dependent or how others use this crate, never
re-explain a substrate concept the defining crate documents.

## 3 Compaction Moves

Apply in order until the sentence fits.

| move                                      | before                                                              | after                                                                |

| name the value, drop `Returns`            | Returns the number of elements that will be written.                | How many it writes.                                                  |
| clause → participle                       | The prefix is dropped after it has been written.                    | …, having dropped the prefix it had written.                         |
| two sentences → semicolon or colon        | `Ok` means all are initialized. `Err` means none are.               | `Ok` means all are initialized; `Err` means none are.                |
| explanation → link                        | See the pin-init docs at <url> for details on `PinInit`.            | It produces a [`PinInit`].                                           |
| condition list → comma list               | `dst` must be aligned. It must be writable. It must not be aliased. | `dst` is aligned, writable, and unaliased.                           |
| `in order to` → `to`; `is used to` → verb | Used in order to build in place.                                    | Builds in place.                                                     |
| `which is` / `that is` → apposition       | A guard, which is a struct that drops the prefix.                   | A guard that drops the prefix.                                       |
| cut the hedge                             | This should generally be preferred for large types.                 | Prefer it for a large `T`.                                           |
| cut the metaphor's setup                  | Think of it as a factory: it hands out values.                      | Hands out values.                                                    |
| reason → fact + consequence               | We chose an alias because we felt a newtype was unnecessary here.   | An alias, not a newtype: every caller already means this exact word. |

## 5 Examples

- The shape: `#![feature(…)]` first if the crate needs it, then `use core::…;`
  lines, a blank line, `use wtx_…::{…};` lines, a blank line, the code.
  `rustfmt` orders them; write them that way.
- Show *why* the item is used, not that it can be called. A small domain type
  (`Leg`, `Order`, `Tag`) beats `Foo`; a real quantity (`4096`, `64 * 1024`)
  beats `42`.
- End with an `assert!`/`assert_eq!` that proves the point. Its message is a
  fragment continuing the sentence: `assert_eq!(first.base().addr().get() % 64,
  0, "carved at the alignment asked for");`.
- Unwrap with `.expect("<why it cannot fail>")`, a fragment: `expect("8 bytes,
  8-aligned")`, `expect("the slack absorbs the pad")`. Never bare `unwrap()`.
- `?` for a real error path, closed by a trailing hidden line, not a wrapper fn:
  `# Ok::<(), core::alloc::LayoutError>(())` or `# Ok::<(), Box<dyn
  core::error::Error>>(())`.
- One `// SAFETY:` line above each `unsafe {}`, same rules as in code
  (`comments.md`).
- One `//` line per non-obvious step, naming the cost or the fact, never the
  operation: `// A `Vec` is byte-aligned, so over-allocate and let the cut find
  the record's alignment.`
- Hide with `# ` only setup that would obscure the point (`#
  install(OwnerId::new(NonZeroU64::MIN))?;`, `# let _ = boxed;`); keep every
  `use` visible.
- Infallible `Result<(), Infallible>` is consumed with `let Ok(()) = …;`, not
  `expect`.
- `no_run` for I/O or a process; `text` for anything that is not Rust; `ignore`
  never.
- Crate examples are the long ones; an item example is the shortest that still
  shows the why. Two items sharing a situation share one example and a link from
  the other.
- Substantive public fns, and every public type a user constructs or drives,
  carry `# Examples`; trivial accessors do not, and a small type whose whole use
  already appears in a neighbour's example (a `Cut` inside `Span::cut`'s) needs
  none of its own.

## 6 Links

- Every item mentioned is an intra-doc link on first use per doc block:
  `[`RunInit`]`, `[`len`](Self::len)`, `[`cut`](Region::cut)`,
  `[`pin_init!`](crate::pin_init)`. Backticks inside the brackets always;
  `[`Foo`](Foo)` is a denied redundancy.
- A path a short name cannot reach goes in the target:
  `[`Layout`](core::alloc::Layout)`, `[`Shared`](crate::Shared)`, or as a
  reference definition at the bottom of the block: `[`Shared`]: crate::Shared`.
- Reference definitions sit at the end of the doc block, in order of first use,
  with short stable labels: `[rust#125632]`, `[goal]`, `[pin-init]`, `[loom]`.
- A crate that is not a dependency cannot be intra-linked
  (`private_intra_doc_links`, broken links are denied): reach it by relative
  HTML path, `[`SeqLock`]: ../wtx_sync/seqlock/struct.SeqLock.html`.
- An unstable, cfg-gated, or foreign item rustdoc cannot resolve is linked by
  URL reference definition, never demoted to a bare code span:
  `[`AtomicPrimitive`]:
  https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/trait.AtomicPrimitive.html`,
  `[loom]: https://docs.rs/loom`.
- A variant gated on `cfg(target_os)` is named in plain backticks on shared
  surfaces; a link to it breaks on the other target.
- Link the noun, never `here`/`docs`/`see`. Never a bare URL (`bare_urls` is
  denied).
- A link replaces an explanation: if the target says it, this doc does not.

## 7 Words and Punctuation

- Clauses hang off a colon or semicolon, or become a participle. No em dash
  (`—`) anywhere; `--` survives only where nothing else reads right, about once
  per crate.
- Backticks on every identifier, path, literal, feature name, lint name, and
  shell command.
- **Bold** for the one load-bearing claim in a block (`**Plain, not atomic, and
  that is the point**`, `Aligns the **address**, not the offset`); *italics* for
  a coined term where it is defined (*initializer*, *place*) or a stressed word
  (`whose contract *is* reclamation`).
- Sentence case for headings; no terminal period on headings, table headers, or
  fragment bullets.
- Numbers as words below ten in prose (`one `T``, `two flags`); digits for
  measurements and code (`7 instructions against 6`, `64 GiB`, `4 KiB`).
- Present tense, indicative. `Prefer …` and `Use …` for guidance, never
  `should`/`must` in prose; `must` belongs in a `# Safety` precondition only
  when the indicative reads wrong.
- One space after a period. No exclamation marks, no emoji, no `e.g.`/`i.e.`
  where `like`/`that is` reads better.
