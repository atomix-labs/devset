# Measuring

Read this before changing code to make it faster, before a benchmark or a
profile, and before a claim about speed in a doc, a commit or a review. Code is
made faster here by measuring it, and a claim of speed is a number someone else
can run again: what was measured, on what machine, with what build, and where
the run is kept. The numbers in these examples were measured, by the benchmark
shown below, on the machine its manifest names. `<commit>` in a path stands for
the short hash of the `HEAD` a run was taken on: the base the change sits on for
a run before it, the change for a run after.

## Measure Before a Change and After, and Keep It Only If the Number Moved

Where a program spends its time is rarely where it is guessed to, so a change
made for speed is measured twice: on the same benchmark, machine and build,
before and after. One change at a time, so each number says what moved it. Two
runs of one build differ too, so the baseline is run twice before the change is,
and the change twice after, and the change moved the number when both of its
p50s pass both of the baseline's, the way the change claims, by more than the
two baseline runs differ and by more than 1%, since two runs that agree to the
nanosecond make any move look real. A change that moved nothing comes out again,
since a form that looks faster and is not only costs its reader.

## Find Where the Time Goes with a Profiler, on the `profiling` Build

A profile says which functions and lines the time is spent in, which is where a
change can pay. `profiling` is `release` with full debug info, packed beside the
binary, and nothing stripped, so a profiler names each function and line of the
code that ships; a dev build's profile shows unoptimized code, whose hot spots
are not the release's. On Linux, `perf record --call-graph dwarf` and `perf
report` read it; samply or Instruments serve elsewhere; no profile pins one, so
use the one the machine has. The workspace's `.gitignore` keeps what they leave,
`perf.data`, a flame graph and `*.profraw`, out of commits.

```text
# Bad: a profile of the dev build, whose hot spots are not the release's.
cargo build -p tiles --bin paint
perf record ./target/debug/paint

## A Benchmark Is a `harness = false` Target, Run by `cargo bench`

A benchmark is a file in the crate's `benches/`, declared as a `[[bench]]` with
`harness = false`, whose own `main` warms up, times and reports. `cargo bench`
builds it with the `bench` profile, `release`'s settings, fat LTO and one
codegen unit, so it measures the code that ships, but built to unwind on a
panic, as Cargo builds every benchmark and test; it runs it with `--bench` after
any arguments given past `--`. A timing inside a `#[test]` measures the `test`
profile, at `opt-level = 0`, and runs beside every other test; Rust's own
`#[bench]` needs nightly. Where the repository already has criterion or divan, a
benchmark uses it; otherwise the file is its own harness, as below. clippy's
`--all-targets` reads a benchmark like any code.

```rust
// Bad: a timing at `opt-level = 0`, beside every other test.
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use core::time::Duration;
    use std::time::Instant;

    #[test]
    fn painting_a_row_is_fast() {
        let mut row = vec![0_u32; 4_096];
        let start = Instant::now();
        row.fill(7);
        assert!(start.elapsed() < Duration::from_micros(10), "a row paints in 10 us");
        assert_eq!(row.first(), Some(&7), "with its tile");
    }
}

## Pass What Is Measured Through `black_box`, Its Input and Its Result

The optimizer deletes work whose result nobody reads, and computes ahead of time
what depends only on constants, so a benchmark that drops its result, or feeds a
constant, can time nothing at all. `core::hint::black_box` hides a value from
the optimizer: around the input, so the work cannot be folded, and around the
result, so it cannot be dropped. `#[inline(never)]` does not do this: a call to
a function with no side effects is still removed when its result is unused. A
`#[must_use]` on a pure function flags a dropped result; it does not stop the
folding.

```rust
use core::time::Duration;
use std::time::Instant;

#[inline(never)]
fn weigh(row: &[u32]) -> u32 {
    row.iter().fold(0, |acc, tile| acc.rotate_left(3) ^ tile.wrapping_mul(0x9e37_79b9))
}

#[must_use]
pub fn time_weigh(row: &[u32]) -> Duration {
    let start = Instant::now();
    // Bad: the result is unused, so the call is removed and nothing is timed.
    weigh(row);
    start.elapsed()
}
```

```rust
use core::hint::black_box;
use core::time::Duration;
use std::time::Instant;

#[inline(never)]
fn weigh(row: &[u32]) -> u32 {
    row.iter().fold(0, |acc, tile| acc.rotate_left(3) ^ tile.wrapping_mul(0x9e37_79b9))
}

#[must_use]
pub fn time_weigh(row: &[u32]) -> Duration {
    let start = Instant::now();
    black_box(weigh(black_box(row)));
    start.elapsed()
}
```

## Warm Up, Repeat, and Report the Distribution, on a Quiet, Pinned Core

The first rounds pay for what later ones do not: cold caches, pages touched for
the first time, a core's clock rising. So a benchmark discards a warm-up, times
many rounds, and reports their distribution, the median, the 99th percentile and
the maximum, since a mean hides the tail a latency is judged by; it reports the
cost of an empty round beside them, the harness's own floor. It runs on one
core, pinned with `taskset -c`, on a machine doing nothing else, so a migration
or a neighbour does not move the number. Where the machine isolates cores
(`/sys/devices/system/cpu/isolated`), a benchmark runs on them; the scheduler
spreads no thread across isolated cores, so a benchmark with several threads
pins each thread itself. It is built first, with `--no-run`, so the build is not
squeezed onto the one core the run is pinned to.

```text
# Bad: one run, on whatever core is free, reported as a mean.
cargo bench -p tiles --bench brightness
```

```text
cargo bench -p tiles --bench brightness --no-run
taskset -c 8 cargo bench -p tiles --bench brightness
```

## A Call Within a Few Times the Floor Is Timed in Batches

Reading the clock twice costs something, the harness's floor, 32 ns on the
Graviton4 of these examples, and a call that costs less reads as the floor: the
brightness benchmark's `glow`, timed a call at a time, reads p50 32 ns. So a
call within a few times the floor is timed in batches: each round makes the call
a thousand times, each through `black_box`, and the round's time is divided by
the batch, which reads p50 0.7 ns. A batch reports what one call costs within a
round, so its maximum is a round's, spread over the batch.

```text
// Bad: the floor, not the call: p50 32 ns.
time("one tile's glow", 1, || {
    black_box(glow(black_box(0.5)));
})?;
```

```text
// A thousand calls a round, each through `black_box`: p50 0.7 ns.
time("one tile's glow", 1_000, || {
    black_box(glow(black_box(0.5)));
})?;
```

## Results Are Committed with What They Were Measured On

A number means nothing without its conditions, and a later change is judged
against the same ones. Each run a change rests on is committed in the crate's
`benches/results/<UTC time>-<commit>-<name>/`: the harness's transcript, and a
manifest of the machine, the kernel and its isolated cores, the toolchain, the
profile and the flags, what was run and the numbers that matter. The raw profile
of a run is never committed; its summary is.

## A Doc That Claims a Speed Cites Its Number and Its Run

"Fast" in a doc is a promise nobody can check. A doc that says one form is
faster than another says by how much, on what input, and where the run is
committed, so a reader can run it again, and a later change can see when the
claim stopped holding.

```rust
/// A row's brightness, summed over eight lanes.
///
// Bad: a claim of speed that nobody can check.
/// Much faster than an ordered sum.
#[must_use]
pub fn brightness(row: &[f32]) -> f32 {
    let (chunks, rest) = row.as_chunks::<8>();
    let mut lanes = [0.0_f32; 8];
    for chunk in chunks {
        for (lane, value) in lanes.iter_mut().zip(chunk) {
            *lane += value;
        }
    }
    lanes.iter().sum::<f32>() + rest.iter().sum::<f32>()
}
```

```rust
/// A row's brightness, summed over eight lanes.
///
/// Seven times as fast as an ordered sum over 4,096 values on a Graviton4, p50
/// 404 ns against 2,959 ns, measured under
/// `benches/results/2026-09-30T04-40Z-<commit>-brightness`. The sum may differ
/// from an ordered one: a little where the values share a sign, and by much
/// more where large values of both signs cancel.

            *lane += value;

## A Claim About Generated Code Is Read in the Binary That Ships

A benchmark says how fast code is, not why: whether a call was inlined, a bounds
check removed or a loop vectorized is read in the machine code of the binary
that ships. Under fat LTO, as `release` and `bench` build, Cargo compiles a
library with `-C linker-plugin-lto`, as bitcode the binary's LTO optimizes
again, and much of the inlining and vectorizing happens there, so `--emit asm`
on the library shows the code before it: a loop that ships vectorized reads as
scalar. So the binary is read: `cargo bench --no-run` prints each benchmark
binary's path, and on Linux `objdump -d -C
--disassemble='brightness::over_lanes' <path>` shows the benchmark's own
`#[inline(never)]` function as it ships, which is the one to read, since a
function inlined into every caller has no symbol of its own and is read in its
caller. With `--config 'profile.release.lto="off"'`, `--emit asm` shows a
crate's own code optimized without LTO, which is close to what ships and is not
it. A call is a `call` or `bl`; a bounds check, a branch to
`panic_bounds_check`; a vectorized loop, packed instructions, `paddd` or `addps`
on x86-64 and `add v0.4s` or `fadd v0.4s` on Arm, where a scalar float addition
is `addss`, in an `xmm` register all the same, or `fadd s0`.

```text
# Bad: the library's code before LTO, where the loop that ships vectorized reads as scalar.
cargo rustc -p tiles --release --lib -- --emit asm=target/tiles.s
```

cargo bench -p tiles --bench brightness --no-run
objdump -d -C --disassemble='brightness::over_lanes' <the benchmark's path>
