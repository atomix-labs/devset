# Cutting Releases

A release is a signed tag, `vX.Y.Z`, on the default branch, and pushing it
starts `release.yml`. The changelog, the versions and the migration notes are
prepared in a pull request, like any change; the tag's push is the one step that
cannot be taken back, so it is the maintainer's. RELEASE.md is the repository's
own account of the steps; this skill is how to carry them out.

## Rules

- **The version says what a user must do.** A breaking change makes a major
  release, or a minor one while the major version is 0; a feature makes a minor;
  fixes alone, a patch. A breaking commit has a `!` after its type, or a footer
  that starts `BREAKING CHANGE:`.
- **The changelog is written from the commits.** A wrong line is fixed by
  rewording its commit, never by editing CHANGELOG.md.
- **Every breaking change has a migration note** in BREAKING-CHANGES.md, under
  the version being cut, where the repository keeps that file: what changed,
  why, and what a user does about it.
- **The release commit is `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`**. It holds the migration
  notes and what `just release` wrote.
- **The maintainer signs and pushes the tag**, on the release commit, once it is
  on the default branch. A published release never changes, so a mistake in one
  is fixed by the next.
- **`release.yml` publishes.** Never run `just publish` by hand.

## Steps

1. **Find what changed** since the last tag:

   ```sh
   git describe --tags --abbrev=0
   git log --format='%h %s%n%b' <last-tag>..HEAD
   ```

2. **Choose the version** by the rule above, and say why.
3. **Branch** from the up-to-date default branch: `release/vX.Y.Z`.
4. **Write it**: `RELEASE_VERSION=X.Y.Z just release` runs every `release-*`
   recipe, which writes the changelog's section.

   It also sets every crate's version, and the lock's.
5. **Read the new section** as a user would. For a line that says too little,
   reword its commit, `git rebase -i <last-tag>`, then run step 4 again.
6. **Write the migration notes** for each breaking change.
7. **Check**: `just check`.
8. **Commit** `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`, and open a pull request; it lands once
   CI passes, as any change does.
9. **Hand over the tag.** Tell the maintainer to run, at the release commit on
   the default branch:

   ```sh
   git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

## What `release.yml` Does

- Builds what every `package-*` recipe packages on each platform, and attests
  every file.
- Publishes the GitHub Release, with the changelog's section as its notes.
- Publishes every crate to crates.io by trusted publishing: no token is stored.
  The job publishes only the versions crates.io lacks, so rerunning it finishes
  a publish that stopped halfway.

## Checks

Once the tag is pushed, `gh run watch` follows the release run, then:

```sh
gh release view vX.Y.Z
gh attestation verify <archive> --repo atomix-labs/devset
```

The Release has the section as its notes.

Every archive is attached, with a `.sha256` beside it.

crates.io lists the new version of every crate.

## What Not to Do

- Do not tag a commit that is not on the default branch, or before CI passes on
  it.
- Do not push, move or delete a tag without the maintainer.
- Do not edit CHANGELOG.md by hand.
- Do not run `just publish`; when the publish job fails, rerun the job.
